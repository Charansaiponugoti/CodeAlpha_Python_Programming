TASK-1_Hangaman_Game:

The Hangman game is an interactive game where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word. The game begins with the choose_word() function, which randomly selects a word from a predefined list. The display_word() function creates a visual representation of the word being guessed, showing guessed letters and placeholders for unguessed letters. The main game loop is the hangman() function, which initializes variables and controls the game flow. The game continues until the word is completely guessed or the player exceeds the maximum allowed incorrect guesses. The game ends with a message indicating the player's win or loss, along with the correct word. The script concludes by calling the hangman() function to start the game.

TASK-3_Basic_Chatbot:

This Python code creates a chatbot with a user responses dictionary, which contains responses for various user inputs. The chatbot function, called chatbot(), initiates the conversation with a greeting and prompts the user to start a conversation. It enters a loop, listens to user input, and if the input is "bye" or "exit", it chooses a random farewell message. If the input matches a key in the dictionary, it prints a response. If the input does not match any key, a default response is provided. The chatbot starts the conversation by calling chatbot(), providing pre-defined responses based on user input. It acknowledges greetings, asks about the user's well-being, responds to specific keywords, and offers farewell messages upon exiting the conversation.
