TASK-1_Hangaman_Game:

The Hangman game is an interactive game where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word. The game begins with the choose_word() function, which randomly selects a word from a predefined list. The display_word() function creates a visual representation of the word being guessed, showing guessed letters and placeholders for unguessed letters. The main game loop is the hangman() function, which initializes variables and controls the game flow. The game continues until the word is completely guessed or the player exceeds the maximum allowed incorrect guesses. The game ends with a message indicating the player's win or loss, along with the correct word. The script concludes by calling the hangman() function to start the game.
