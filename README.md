Main Game Loop: The hangman() function serves as the core of the game, initializing variables and controlling the game flow.
  It initializes the game by selecting a word, setting up data structures, and displaying the initial state of the word.
  It prompts the player to guess a letter and validates the input.
  It provides feedback on each guess, updating the guessed letters and incorrect guesses count accordingly.
The game continues until the word is completely guessed or the player exceeds the maximum allowed incorrect guesses.
Game Outcome: After the game ends, it displays a message indicating whether the player won or lost, along with the correct word.
Execution: The script concludes by calling the hangman() function to start the game.
Overall, this Hangman game provides an interactive experience where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word. It offers feedback on each guess and ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or exceeds the maximum allowed incorrect guesses.
